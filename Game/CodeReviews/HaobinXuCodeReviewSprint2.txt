Comments on Quality:
	-Definitely clear blocks of code, extremely easy to read, understand and modify.
	-The switch block at the very end seems to be unnecessary from my perspective. 
	-Also, at the begining of the Execute() block, I would prefer to declear IItem mush along with IMario to be 
	 the two gameObjects instead of declearing the mush afterward, since it is not a special case during the 
	 block. Declearing it beforehand would not cause further problem meanwhile make the code a little bit more 
	 friendly to read.

Hypothetical Change:
	-Change the switch case block at very end to a if block(for now), since a switch case with only one case in
	 it would be a huge overkill. Even in future sprints, if the calculation of points accumulated is needed to 
	 be implemented, only an else case is necessary since there is no need to change Mario's shape other than 
	 small Mario.
