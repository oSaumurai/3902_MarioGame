Comments on Quality: 
Easy to understand and to extend.
It is a class used to keep track of the score mario within 3 lifes. 
ScoringSystem is loose in coupling since it uses no concrete classes of the project.
It is considered high cohesion since the score integer is used through all the methods that add the score.
The methods and integer initialization is easy to read and understand by name. The scoring is easy to 
be understand by grouping all scoring circunmstances together in a scoring system.


Hypo changes: 
The static number for flag cutoff point and score for the cutoff are better to be put into a together to a 
file that note all of the data need for the game. By doing this, it would be easier to have other grading idea 
added if we want to make changes to the grading instead of flag pole. I mean like in the water, the constant int
will need to be changed. So I guess like using the portion of a flagpole for the grading scale is a better idea.
