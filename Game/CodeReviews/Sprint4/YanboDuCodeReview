Comments:
	- First of all, clear structed class, only serving for scoring system. 
    - I see commented code in AddPointsForPole(). In my opinion, if it's not necessary just delete it or add some explanations for why it is be commented.
    - For the part for pole score, it is a little bit to follow. Probably switch structure is a better choice.

Hypothetical changes:
	- Move all the data to GameData.cs. In this way, it is much easier to change the value if we decide to do it. 
    - In my opinion, RegisgerFlagPole() should not be included here because it is not a part of the functionality of scoring system which could be refactored.
