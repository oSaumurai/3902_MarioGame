Comments on Quality:
	-Each variable is named and marked with comprehensive name which is easy for other coleague to understand.
	-Harness the use of sprite factory so that each text is resuing the code.
	-Some of the spaces between texts are there because of the usage of "space" in text output, quite smart.

Minutes Taken:10 min

Hypothetical Change:
	-Using the space to manage the density of text is useful in current gamebut however, when some number goes 
	 single digit to two digit or even more, there might be some display offset. So that the usage of coordinates
	 for texts are still recommended.
	-Some variable's name could be abbreviated so that it will be much easier meanwhile faster for other coder to
	 go through.
