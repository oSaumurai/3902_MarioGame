Comments:
	-Name seems to be long but it definitely easy for others to understand what is being called or created.
	-Using inheritance made the class and each single peers is extremely easy for future modification.
	-Using similiar draw and update scheme with past Mario(runningbig, runningsmall) made it clear for other coder to understand.

Hypothetical changes:
	- Current swimming frame and swimming frame increment could be decleared or announced in the parent interface so that the code will be more reusable.
