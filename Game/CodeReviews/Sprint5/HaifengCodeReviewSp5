Quality: 
-Benefit from the IEnemy interface, we do not need to write specific collision response for the enemies. 
-Consistent format with other enemy object, easy to maintain.
-The collision response will have tight coupling with these enemies.
-Like in previous sprint mentioned, the enemy have a little bit different structure compared with mario.
the mario has a abstract class to inhereted. In enemies, we need to put all the methods again if we want
to add a new enemy.

Hypothetical change:
-To make it easier to extend could put an enemyObject abstract class contained all the methods. Override
when needed.

Time used: 15min.
