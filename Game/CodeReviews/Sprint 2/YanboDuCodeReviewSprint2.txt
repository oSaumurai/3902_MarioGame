Comments on Quality:
	- Good readability.
	- Relatively long class. It's possible to separate LoadMario, LoadBlock and LoadItem in a different class.
	- LoadMarioStart probably is redundant because it is only need once when the game start.

Minutes Taken:15 min

Hypothetical Change:
	- Create concrete class for function implementation.
	- Initialize the mario position at Game1.cs
