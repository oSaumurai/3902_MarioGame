Comments on Quality:
	-Well origanized statemachine for mario. Easy to read, the block, enemy, item states are 
	separated in different methods.	Along with all methods names, the cases for different states 
	are easy to read and change.
	

Minutes Taken:10 min

Hypothetical Change:
	-Of course it's sprint2 and this work only satisfied the current requirement. 
	We need to put the state change of block enemy to other	class since they are
	not the respond of Mario.
