Comments on Quality:
	-MarioState is having way to much methods for a single class as itself.
	-Actually the Descend() method is not necessary, since the descend could be implemented along with the crouch movement.
	 Using a descend method would be creating special case for the program to handle.
	-Also, Terminate() is also a special case.

Hypothetical Change:
	-Refactoring is recommended, which would make the mariostate much more easier to read and further understand.
	-Implement the vertical movement along with the crouch movement so that no special case would be created.
	-Ideally, dead mario could also have directions etc, but it just simply does not react to any future changes. This can 
	 unify the structure of each state of Mario and make it more friendly to read.
