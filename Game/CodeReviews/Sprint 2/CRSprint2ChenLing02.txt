Code Quality:
This class has good readability. You just create a single class for mario transition. 
Your if block, especially the use of switch block is very smart because it can clearly show the state changes under different complex conditions. 
However, I suggest you desparating mario and block changes in this class in order to improve the code quality. 

Flexitiblity and hypothetical change:
You can actually add another class for block state change in a specific folder to indicate the transition of blocks. 
Also, the enemy state change, the item state change (appear/disappear) can also be implemented in the same folder.
