Readiblity:
Haobin constantly conforms to a good naming convention in these files. 
All class members and parameters are in Camel Casing style while the names of classes, properties and methods are in Pascal style. 
The names of the variables and methods are clear and easy to understand. Also ItemSpriteFactory is a nice try. 
Here Haobin declares all of the necessary variables and texture coordinates, which can be easily found and used in the future.

Flexitiblity to Hypothetical Change:
Adding a state machine class for item might be better. 
For instance, if a missing mode is needed for coin, 
what Haobin needs to do is simply to add a boolean variable named "isMissing" to indicated the state of coin and add a MissingCoin implementation in an ItemStateMachine class. 
And then only some minor changes in the state machine class are needed for the state transitions.
