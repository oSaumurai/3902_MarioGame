Comments on Quality:
-Arrangement with state machine for blocks
-BlockSprite execution written to Game1.cs may not be clean, it is better to be put into command style
to keep consistence with the Mariocommand.

time taken: 20 mins

Hypothetical changes:
-In the collision work later, bump state could be made a boolean to determine whether the block is hit.
Which means no matter which type of bricks could all be controlled by that block state;
